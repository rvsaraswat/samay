    The South Indian Svarna-Gowri Vrata/Gowri Habba is identified with the
    Bhadrapada Shukla Tritiya Gauri (Haritalika) vrata discussed by Dharma
    Sindhu. Its date rule deliberately favors the later, Chaturthi-yukta
    Tritiya and strongly rejects a Dwitiya-yukta observance:

    * If Tritiya prevails at sunrise on one day, use that day.
    * If a vriddhi Tritiya prevails at two consecutive sunrises, use the
      later day even when only a minute remnant remains. Dharma Sindhu says
      to reject even a full sixty-ghati Tritiya on the earlier day because
      conjunction with Chaturthi gives the later observance greater merit.
    * Only in the kshaya case, when Tritiya falls wholly between two
      sunrises and no Chaturthi-yukta sunrise day exists, use the earlier
      civil day on which sunrise still has Dwitiya.

    Thus "one day before Ganesa Caturthi" is the usual consequence, not the
    controlling rule. Each vrata is independently resolved from its own
    tithi rule, which also handles skipped and repeated tithis correctly.
    Adhika Bhadrapada is excluded.

    Ayudha Puja (also Shastra Puja, Astra Puja, or Khande Navami) is treated
    here as a regional observance distinct from Dharma Sindhu's Mahanavami
    puja/upavasa rule. The festival belongs to the civil day on which Shukla
    Navami prevails at local sunrise (udaya-vyapini).

    A long, or vriddhi, Navami can prevail at two consecutive sunrises. In
    that case the earlier civil day (purva) is selected. It contains the
    fuller Navami daytime; the later day contains only Navami's ending
    portion. Two useful regression examples from Drik Panchang are:

    * 2000: Navami ran Oct 6 05:48 to Oct 7 08:25 in New Delhi, covering both
      sunrises; Ayudha Puja was Friday, Oct 6.
    * 2034: Navami ran Oct 21 06:04 to Oct 22 06:34 in New Delhi, again
      covering both sunrises; Ayudha Puja was Saturday, Oct 21.

    The advertised "Ayudha Puja Vijaya Muhurat" does not select the civil
    date. It is the recommended eleventh daytime muhurta on the date already
    selected by the sunrise rule. This distinction matters: in ordinary
    years that window can begin after astronomical Navami has ended, while
    the sunrise-defined festival day remains Ayudha Puja.

    If Navami is skipped at sunrise, the observance falls on the civil day
    whose sunrise-to-sunrise span contains Navami. Drik Panchang's Helsinki
    2005 result is a regression example: Navami ran from Oct 11 08:59 to
    Oct 12 06:43, and Ayudha Puja was Oct 11.
