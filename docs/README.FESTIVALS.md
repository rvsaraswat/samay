Festival dates and conventions
==============================

See [README.CALENDARS.md](README.CALENDARS.md) for general PDF usage. This file documents
festival configuration and how festival dates are computed.
Lunar-month *display* may be amānta or pūrṇimānta; the festival catalog itself
is keyed by amānta month numbers so civil dates stay stable across display
modes.

Festival and Ekadashi dates are resolved for the selected location in
`festival_rules.py` (ruleset `Udaya-Vyapini-1.1`). The older multi-policy
implementation is kept under `experimental/` for reference only.

Selecting festivals
-------------------

Which festivals appear in the PDF is controlled by `config/festivals.cfg`.
The `[festivals]` section is shared by the annual and monthly PDFs; its `yes`
entries are included in both. The annual PDF supports at most 30 festivals
because its footer is a fixed 6×5 grid. The optional `[extra]` section is used
only by the monthly PDF, so its `yes` entries can add festivals beyond that
annual limit.

Names in `[festivals]` and `[extra]` must not overlap. Festival names are not
pinned to either section: you may move any catalog name between them. Placement
controls scope: `yes` in `[festivals]` enables it in both PDFs, while `yes` in
`[extra]` enables it only in the monthly PDF. Use `no` to disable it in that
section. Every catalog name must appear in one of the two sections. Values may
be `yes`/`no` (also `true`/`false`, `1`/`0`, `on`/`off`). Unknown names are
rejected when the monthly selection is loaded. Override the path with
`--festivals FILE.cfg` if needed.

The shipped defaults are a regional compromise; edit the cfg to match your
locality. The `[festivals]` section contains the 30 annual festivals. The
`[extra]` section contains monthly-only entries and disabled catalog entries,
including Mesha and Makara Sankranti (which are already marked by the PDF's
solar saṅkrānti grid), Karwa Chauth, Gita Jayanti, and Chhath.

Recurring observances vs annual festivals
-----------------------------------------

The festival catalog is configured through `festivals.cfg`. Fortnightly/monthly
observances are always on and need no cfg keys -- they are painted as
coloured bars on the monthly grid (every occurrence) and as underlines on
the annual page (weekday specials by default: Pradosham (Mon/Sat),
Sankashtahara (Tue); `--recurring all` underlines every occurrence).
Both are explained in the footer legends:

* **Ekadashi** -- every `S11` and `K11` at sunrise (teal bar + vrat name).
  Pāraṇā uses the next civil day as its operational break-fast day; vṛddhi
  anchors it after ekādaśī ends. The monthly PDF shows a practical four-ghaṭikā
  window as ``Pāraṇā: HH:MM – HH:MM``.
* **Pradosham** -- Trayodashi (`S13` or `K13`) prevailing at sunset
  (purple bar). This bimonthly Shiva festival occurs twice per lunar month.
  Vriddhi keeps the earlier day when Trayodashi prevails at sunset on
  consecutive days; kshaya picks the latter civil day when Trayodashi is
  skipped between two sunsets. Without location/timezone, falls back to
  sunrise-based selection.
* **Sankashtahara Chaturthi** -- Krishna Chaturthi (`K4`) prevailing at the
  Hindu-day moonrise in ``[sunrise, next sunrise)`` (indigo bar). Same window
  as the calendar Moon line, so a pre-sunrise rise is attributed to the
  previous civil date. Occurs during Krishna Paksha. Vriddhi keeps the earlier
  day when K4 prevails at moonrise on consecutive days; kshaya picks the
  latter civil day when K4 is skipped between two moonrises. Without
  location/timezone, falls back to sunrise-based selection.

Common sunrise rule (udaya-vyāpinī)
-----------------------------------

A festival tied to a tithi uses the civil day where that tithi prevails at local
sunrise.

- If the same tithi covers two consecutive sunrises (vriddhi), the earlier day
  is kept.
- If the tithi is skipped between sunrises (kshaya), the later civil day is kept.

Adhika (intercalary) masas are skipped for ordinary festivals. Ugadi is the
exception: when both adhika and nija Chaitra `S1` occur, only the adhika date is
marked.

Most numbered festivals are plain lunar-masa + tithi pairs under that rule (for
example Rama Navami = Chaitra `S9`, Deepavali = Ashvina `K15`). The catalog
stores those masa numbers in the amānta convention so a festival’s civil date
is stable whether the PDF/WebUI *displays* amānta or pūrṇimānta māsa names.
Ekadashi underlines use the same sunrise rule for every `S11` and `K11`; they
are not the *Dharma-sindhu* four-ghati Arunodaya / Mahadvadashi machinery.

Non-tithi festivals
-------------------

These have dedicated selectors (dispatch by catalog name):

* **Varamahalakshmi Vrata** -- Friday strictly before nija Sravana Purnima
  (`S15`).
* **Yajur Upakarma** -- nija Sravana `S15`. If eclipsed (see below), postpone to
  Bhadrapada `S15`.
* **Rig Upakarma** -- nija day whose sunrise nakshatra is Sravana (`22`); if
  that nakshatra is missing at sunrise in Sravana masa, or the chosen day is
  eclipsed (see below), use Bhadrapada's Sravana-nakshatra day. Vriddhi keeps
  the former sunrise.

  Upakarma eclipse test (Yajur and Rig): postpone when the instant of a
  locally visible non-penumbral lunar eclipse's maximum falls inside the
  Hindu day that starts on the chosen date, i.e. inside
  `[sunrise, next sunrise)`. An eclipse before that morning's sunrise
  therefore belongs to the previous date: it does not postpone the chosen
  Upakarma day, and it does not mark that day's cell either. Solar and purely
  penumbral lunar eclipses are ignored. Using the same window as the printed
  wavy eclipse mark keeps a date and its cell in agreement; using the
  maximum's moment avoids interval arithmetic.
* **Onam** -- sunrise nakshatra Sravana (`22`) while the Sun is in Simha
  (raasi 5); if none, try Kanya (raasi 6). Same vriddhi / empty-primary
  pattern as Rig Upakarma, but keyed on solar rasi rather than lunar masa, and
  with no eclipse test.
* **Vaikuntha Ekadashi** -- a Margashirsha or Pausha Shukla Ekadashi upavasa
  day while the Sun is in Dhanur at sunrise. If none qualify, the PDF prints
  `None`.
* **Mesha Sankranti** / **Makara Sankranti** -- first civil sunrise after the
  Sun enters Mesha (raasi 1) or Makara (raasi 10) respectively. Both use the
  shared sankranti helper, the same rule as the twelve solar-month markers on
  the PDF.
* **Uttarayana** / **Dakshinayana** -- first civil sunrise after the tropical
  winter / summer solstice moment, respectively. At or north of the equator,
  Uttarayana uses the December solstice and Dakshinayana the June solstice;
  these assignments switch south of the equator. The event moment is compared
  with the local sunrise JD, so a solstice after sunrise is printed on the next
  civil day. Both are on by default in ``festivals.cfg``.

Location dependence
-------------------

Dates are sunrise- and location-dependent, so the same festival can fall on
different Gregorian days in different cities. Above the polar circles, where
the Sun goes days or months without rising or setting, `panchanga.sunrise()`
and `panchanga.sunset()` fall back to the matching meridian transit (solar
noon in polar night, solar midnight in midnight sun), so festivals resolve
for any city on any date. See "Polar regions" in the top-level README.

Rationale
---------

### Inconsistent sindhu books

*Dharma-sindhu* and *Nirnaya-sindhu* decide many observances with layered kala
tests (Arunodaya, Purvahna, Madhyahna, Aparahna, Pradosha, Nishitha),
viddha/adhikya cases, Bhadra checks, and puja-muhurta detail. That apparatus
matters for ritual timing, but it is a poor fit for a one-page PDF calendar
whose job is to mark which *civil day* carries each festival for a given city
and year. There is usually no consistent logic either; just that regional and
historical preferences are codified in these books. For a universal Hindu, these
principles are meaningless.

For example, "4-ghati before arunodaya" maps to 96 minutes before sunrise, which
is acceptable in India, but at higher latitudes (e.g. Europe or USA), there
might not be 96 minutes after sunset and next sunrise at all! Another example:
Dussehra is decided by daśamī-during-pūrvāhna in Bengal and Kerala but the rest
of India follows daśamī-during-aparāhna -- there is no logical reason to prefer
one over the other.

Another point of contention is Ekadashi rules between Vaishnavas and
non-Vaishnavas. Before computerised Panchangas, many pandits used to calculate
tithis and nakshatras using simplified arithmetic, which would lead to
inaccuracies. Consider at sunrise daśamī tithi which ends, say, 30 min after
sunrise. Until about a century ago, a temple priest might've computed that day
as ekādaśī-at-sunrise (due to approximate formulas) and unintentionally led a
devotee to fast on the wrong day. Therefore, Vaiṣṇavas came up with a rule: do
not observe fasting on the day when daśamī was still active 48 minutes _before_
sunrise -- this would tolerate computational errors by pandits. A similar logic
was applied for breaking the fast (pāraṇa): do not break fast until 25% of
dvādaśī has elapsed (this would tolerate errors in dvādaśī-at-sunrise
computation). However, we don't need such complexities today, for we can compute
panchanga exactly for any given day and location. Ekadashi fasting is for
spiritual upliftment, not panchanga appeasement.

Another drawback is the dissimilarity in the name of the festival and its
observance. Naraka Chaturdashi and Deepavali always occur on the same day,
sometimes on Chaturdashi and sometimes on Amavasya -- the festival name of
"Chaturdashi" becomes meaningless. Consider 2026 Helsinki example:

| Date   | Tithi at sunrise  | Dharma Sindhu                 | Udaya-vyāpinī      |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| Nov 6  | Trayodashi        | Dhanteras (dhana trayodashi)  | Dhanteras          |
| Nov 7  | Chaturdashi       | No festival today             | Naraka Chaturdashi |
| Nov 8  | Amavasya          | Naraka Chaturdashi, Deepavali | Deepavali          |
| Nov 9  | Amavasya (adhika) | Bali Padyami                  | Nothing            |
| Nov 10 | Pratipada         | No festival today             | Bali Padyami       |
| Oct 19 | Ashtami           | Durgashtami, Mahanavami       | Durgashtami        |
| Oct 20 | Navami            | Vijayadashami                 | Mahanavami         |
| Oct 21 | Dashami           | No festival today             | Vijayadashami      |

The very name "Bali Padyami" presupposes that the festival occurs on the day of
Pāḍya, i.e. Pratipadā but Dharma Sindhu's complex rules assigns it to Amavasya
day. Our Udaya-vyāpinī ruleset restores the consistency, as also followed by the
[official holiday calendar][holiday-calendar].

### Sane rules

This calendar therefore uses a single shared rule for ordinary tithi festivals
and for Ekadashi underlines: *udaya-vyāpinī* (tithi ownership at local sunrise),
with fixed vriddhi and kshaya handling. The aims are:

* One rule that readers can understand without reading a dense book.
* Deterministic dates for any year and location where sunrise exists.
* Enough uniformity that the same engine covers the whole catalog instead of
  a different special case per festival.

Divergence from traditional printed panchangas and from civil holiday lists
is expected and accepted. Two concrete motivations for the vriddhi/kshaya
choices:

* This 'kshaya' logic helps us to avoid celebrating festivals on Amavasya day.
  For example, in India, 2026-03-19 is Amavasya and the next day is
  śukla-dvitīya. Traditional (Dharma-sindhu) calendar celebrates the Hindu New
  Year (Ugadi) on Amavasya day though, according to the same book, Caitra month
  begins on the next day! Would you celebrate the New Year's Day in December
  although the new year begins in January? Nope! Another example: You want to
  enjoy a festival feast on Vijaya Dashami (Dussehra) but the Ekadashi is
  kshaya. As per above the rule, the fasting is pushed to the next day after
  Dussehra, so no problem.

* The 'vriddhi' rule prioritises the principle that one should _never_ eat
  during the maximal window of an ekadashi tithi. For example, in Tirupati, both
  2027-03-03 and 2027-03-04 at sunrise are Ekadashi (no daśamī-vedha). Yet, all
  calendars (incl. Dharma-sindhu, Smarta, Madhva, Srivaishnava) prescribe
  fasting on the latter date, essentially allowing food consumption on the
  entire 3rd March which has ahorātra ekādaśī tithi! Defeats the whole emphasis
  on ekadasi fasting. Different sampradāyas may differ on pāraṇa rules (breaking
  the fast), that's alright, but in my opinion, keeping upavāsa is more
  important.

Ekadashi fast is broken on the next civil day after sunrise for normal and
kṣaya observances. In the kṣaya case, this is normally Trayodaśī sunrise because
upavāsa was kept on the Dvādaśī-at-sunrise day. For vṛddhi, the pāraṇā anchor is
``max(next sunrise, ekādaśī end)``. The operational pāraṇā deadline is four
ghaṭikās (96 minutes) after that anchor; the rule intentionally does not wait
for a potentially next-morning Dvādaśī end. The monthly PDF prints
``Pāraṇā: HH:MM – HH:MM`` using an en dash. This is a simplified practical
calendar rule, not a sampradāya-specific pāraṇa calculation.

Rules that are not plain masa+tithi markers (Sankranti, Onam, Upakarma,
Varamahalakshmi, Vaikuntha Ekadashi) keep dedicated selectors, still written
in the same sunrise-first spirit. The older multi-policy / *Dharma-sindhu*
experiments remain under `experimental/` for comparison.
