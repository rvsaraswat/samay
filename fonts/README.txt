IndUni-H (Helvetica-compatible, Indology/IAST)
=============================================

``IndUni-H.ttc`` is a TrueType Collection of the four IndUni-H faces
(Regular, Bold, Oblique, BoldOblique) for ReportLab PDF embedding.

Upstream zip: IndUni-H.zip (OpenType/CFF on URW Nimbus Sans L).
License: GNU GPL v2 or later (GPL-2.0+) —

  The upstream notice (``README-H``) cites the GPL without naming a
  version, which under GPLv2 §9 lets the recipient use any version
  ever published by the FSF; Debian ships the same upstream fonts as
  GPL-2.0+ (fonts-johnsmith-induni copyright file).
Upstream notes: ``README-H``.

ReportLab face indices in the collection:

  0  IndUni-H-Regular
  1  IndUni-H-Bold
  2  IndUni-H-Oblique
  3  IndUni-H-BoldOblique

Rebuild (maintainer; needs ``fonttools`` once):

  ./scripts/build_induni_ttc.sh

That script downloads IndUni-H.zip and converts faces with fontTools'
``Snippets/otf2ttf.py`` (fetched from GitHub; not kept in this repo).
